# Features

A user is able to:

* Sign up if they are a new user
* Sign in
* Select a photo from their gallery
* Take a photo with their camera
* Get results of scanned photo
* Edit their account details

An administrator is able to 
* Sign in
* View and delete users
* View some statistics on a dashboard
* Generate a report on most frequently detected diseases

# What I Learned

* How to create a convolutional neural network that uses computer vision to detect tomato diseases
* How to integrate a machine learning model with a Flutter application
* CRUD operations on Firebase Firestore database
* Asynchronous functions in Flutter
